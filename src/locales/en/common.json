    "description": "Programming is one of my greatest passions, but not everything in my life revolves around it. I am a persistent and creative person, always looking to balance my interests. I love football, playing chess, watching movies, and exploring the world by visiting new places. My main focus has been on studying technologies and improving my programming logic until I felt comfortable enough to share what I know, in my own way. Unlike traditional classes or courses that focus on formal theories, my goal is to teach programming in a more natural way, without the need to read manuals or use technical language that might be complicated."
